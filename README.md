## :hammer: How to build app

- Recommended: Using the newest version of Android Studio Canary (JellyFish+).
- 1. You must add `google-services.json` inside `app/`
- 2. You must put maps value `API_KEY` into `AndroidManifests.xml` to build and run app
```XML
    <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="${API_KEY}" />
```

## build with Bazel for speed up and manage code artifacts

`$ bazel build //app:example_app`

## :tram: Data flow

Application is supported by `Flow` and `Suspend` for data stream flow in app.

## :x: Error flow

In data module, when response returned error, we should transform the error to `ResponseException`. In domain and features module, we transform the error from `ResponseException` to `AppDomainException` to display error in to UI.

## Modularization
To achieve low coupling, high cohesion with maximum reusability & scalable code base, this project is modularized.
This app consist of following modules:

- app
- feature home
- feature search
- feature common
- data
- domain
- common composable
- common theme
- core
